# Pullchain

HomeKit interface for shared control of a pullchain lamp

Modified an Ikea pullchain lamp, separated the bulb socket from the pullchain mechanism.  The pullchain comes down to pull a GPIO high that is normally grounded.  Separately there is another GPIO that is driving a 120v relay for the bulb socket.
